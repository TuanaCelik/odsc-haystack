This is an accompanying reposiyory to the 'Composing Agentic AI Applications as a Graph with Haystack' talk at ODSC, London, 2024

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TuanaCelik/odsc-haystack/blob/main/agentic-pipelines-haystack.ipynb)

Learn the basics about:
- Approaching AI applications as a graph
- Learn how to use and build with Haystack components
- Create Haystack pipelines for:
    - Indexing
    - RAG
    - Self reflection for entity extraction
    - Creating a 'quiz generation' agent

### To run the examples:
- Create a `.env` file and add your `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Go ahead and play around with the code in `agentic-pipelines-haystack.ipynb`
